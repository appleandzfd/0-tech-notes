Fix github push error:

when using github in the office through proxy, even though I set right the proxy address using:

export http_proxy=xxxxx
export https_proxy=xxxxx

I cannot push to the remote successfully.
Howerver I can successuflly git pull using https or http proxy.

After stackoverflowing the answers, I find that using following method fix the problem:(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7700824/rpc-failed-result-28-http-code-0)

git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000

after setting it, you can git push as much as you like, enjoy it!

=========================================================================

No other means could fix it and I could only use https proxy to post because of the network setting in the office.
