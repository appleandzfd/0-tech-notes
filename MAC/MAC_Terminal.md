HowTo use a good MAC terminal?

* Use iTerm2 as the default terminal instead of the default version.
* Import the color scheme that can show much more scheme.(see [here](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes))
* Use Oh-my-zsh, which is based on the /bin/zsh, that can have much more powerful function than then the bash(see [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh))
* Configure the environment
	* set the ~/.zshrc, and our self defined ~/.zsh_rc, add more variables and alias
	* set font, by default there will some errors when showing the characters(use powerline font)(see [here](https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git), and [here](https://github.com/powerline/powerline.git))


We can also change the `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/XXX`, which will change the style, by default I want to use it shorter before the `~`, so I just remove the `%m` so that it works well.

More information and errors can be resolved by the issues of `oh-my-zsh` and our trail according to the error information.
