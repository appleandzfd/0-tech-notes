## Standard setting for gvim/Vim in /etc/vim/vimrc.
### Note: I use it in my office with gvim & vim

set nu
set tabstop=4
set expandtab
set shiftwidth=4
set nobackup
set softtabstop=4
" encoding
set encoding=utf-8
set termencoding=utf-8
set fileencoding=utf-8
"set fileencodings=ucs-bom,utf-8,chinese,latin-1
set fileencodings=ucs-bom,utf-8,cp936,gb18030,big5,euc-jp,euc-kr,latin1
set langmenu=zh_CN.utf-8
set fileformats=unix,dos
source $VIMRUNTIME/delmenu.vim
source $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim
language messages zh_CN.UTF-8

### Doesn't need to set for /etc/vim/gvim as it may read /etc/vim/vimrc
### the location /usr/share/vimrc or gvimrc is soft link to /etc/vim/vimrc or gvimrc, so don't need to change it when you change /etc/vim/vimrc it will refer to it
